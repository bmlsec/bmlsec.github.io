Tweeting my first blog post, I found myself thanking several people (unfortunately not all - twitter restrictions) that inspired me on my new path.

And today I thought, why not pass these thanks on to the blog?

That is exactly what I am doing, I do it because it gives me a great pleasure to share what these people have made me feel and the way they have helped me, even though they don't know me... they don't just help me, they help the community, anyone who reads this can benefit from it.

I will edit this page as I see fit, for now I will start by thanking and showing my appreciation, in no particular order, to:

## STÖK

It was STÖK that introduced me to Bug Bounties, through a youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CU9Iafc-Igs) earlier last year ... until then, I didn't even know that someone could pay hackers to test their platforms ... it was a turning point!

I started to dig deeper and discovered a fantastic community, where people help each other and encourage others to join the game.

Since then I follow STÖK regularly and I especially like the talks he has online with several other leading players, in which he reveals his most personal side... even without knowing him personally, I admire his path and what he does for others, that is the main reason for writing these words.

**THANK YOU** Fredrik for your precious help, I still don't know you personally, but I know I will... sooner or later our path will surely cross.

## NahamSec

Speaking of Bug Bounties, I have to mention Ben Sadeghipour. 

What he has been doing for the community is amazing, his passion is contagious. He delivers knowledge for all of us in a daily basis, I cannot thank him enough.

Ben is boosting this community forward, he tries to help everyone, not holding anything back.

For me, he is a valuable resource, an awesome human being that I've learned to respect.

**THANK YOU** Ben for all the hours of dedication to the community, see you in the next live session.

## Zseano

Sean Roesner is also a reference on Bug Bounties.

He's not just a very successfully bug hunter, he really cares about others and reaches out to the community with great content and valuable resources.

Helped me a lot with `bugbountynotes` and his videos of live hacking. You can study, read, listening to people... but seeing someone else doing it live, has incalculable value, you learn the though process.

**THANK YOU** Sean for all the hard work that you have been doing for the community, hope `bugbountynotes` can return soon.

## IppSec

Speaking of being able to transmit the though proccess, I have to mention IppSec!

He makes youtube videos with great content, he shows the mistakes, the dead ends... all the effort that he commits in his work, is just breathtaking. I can spend hours on just one of his videos, taking notes, trying every command, even the simple ones... it's just great value for me, and I think for all the community.

**THANK YOU** IppSec for all the hard work you put in for all of us, you're awesome!

## John Hammond

Continuing on the subject of ability to transmit the thought process, what to say about John Hammond? Just... PHENOMENAL!

It's addictive to see him work on the challenges, I also have to spend way much more time than just _see_ the video, I have to take severel notes and end up learning tones of good stuff. Same as with IppSec, all the little things... priceless!

Also, on the less technical side, his latest [podcast interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob7-nTpBgjQ) showed very valuable info for us.

**THANK YOU** John for all the time spent creating content for the community, amazing stuff that only you can deliver like that.

## The Cyber Mentor

Heath Adams, aka The Cyber Mentor - TCM. 

I have engaged in his [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/) and it's not wasted time, not even one minute of it. Great stuff in there, well worthed the insignificant price for all the content. Also, on youtube he has tons of free content for all of us. Time well spent.

Heath is working actively for the community, he knows, he shares, he teaches... he cares! 

**THANK YOU** Heath for all the hard work that you take from your busy life to teach us, respect!

## Final Thoughts

This list could be huge, I just mentioned a few fellow hackers that helped me a lot during the last year. Of course that are plenty more, to which I am deeply grateful, but for now I'll stick with a small list...

The final **THANK YOU** goes for you, reader of this text, I hope you liked.

Follow your Dreams!
