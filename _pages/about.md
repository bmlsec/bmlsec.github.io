Welcome to my Blog!

Every day, I learn more and more about the cybersecurity field, this is my way to give back to this incredible community.
I know it is only a small contribution, but it will help me to grow and, hopefully, it will also help other people along the way.

In addition to cybersecurity, I am passionate about aviation, sustainable living, nature, meditation, yoga and everything else that makes me a little bit happy every day.

Follow your dreams!

Enjoy!
